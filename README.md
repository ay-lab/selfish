# SELFISH

SELFISH (Discovery of Differential Chromatin Interactions via a Self-Similarity Measure) is a tool by Abbas Roayaei Ardakany, Ferhat Ay (ferhatay@lji.org), and Stefano Lonardi. This Python implementation is currently maintained by Tuvan Gezer (tgezer@sabanciuniv.edu). The original MATLAB implementation by Abbas (roayaei@gmail.com) can be found at https://github.com/ucrbioinfo/SELFISH.

SELFISH is a tool for finding differential chromatin interactions between two Hi-C contact maps. It uses self-similarity to model interactions in a robust way. For more information read the full

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, along with all the dependencies listed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ay-lab/selfish
./selfish/selfish/selfish.py -f1 /path/to/contact/map1.txt \
                             -f2 /path/to/contact/map2.txt \

### Nextflow

If you have any problem regarding dependencies or version mismatches, we recommend using <a href="https://www.nextflow.io/" target="_blank">Nextflow</a> with a container technology like <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started" target="_blank">Docker</a> or <a href="https://singularity.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">Singularity</a>. These methods require Nextflow(Can be installed with a single command that doesn't require special permissions.), and the desired container technology to be available.
Program arguments are given to Nextflow with two dashes and the short format listed below.
**Updating:** If Nextflow warns that your project is outdated, use `nextflow pull ay-lab/selfish` in order to update to latest version.

### Input Formats

SELFISH supports 3 different input formats. **Plain text**, **.hic**, **.cool**, **.bed/.matrix** pairs (HiC-Pro format).

#### Text Contact Maps

Contact maps need to have the following format. They must not have a header.
Values must be separated by either a space, a tab, or a comma.

| Chromosome | Midpoint 1 | Chromosome | Midpoint 2 | Contact Count |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| chr1       | 5000       | chr1       | 65000      | 438           |
| chr1       | 5000       | chr1       | 85000      | 12            |
| ...        | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...           |

#### Bed-Matrix pairs (HiC-Pro format)

**User must provide a chromosome with the -ch argument.**
.bed and .matrix files must have the same name other than the extension.
Either file name can be provided as an input for selfish and the program will search for the second file automatically.

#### HiC file

**User must provide a chromosome with the -ch argument.**
Selfish uses juicer's _straw_ tool to read .hic files.

#### .cool file

**User must provide a chromosome with the -ch argument.**
Selfish uses _cooler_ to read .cool files.

#### Bias (normalization) File

Bias file need to have the following format.
Bias file must use the same midpoint format as the contact maps.
Bias file must not have a header.

| Chromosome | Midpoint | Bias  |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- |
| chr1       | 5000     | 1.012 |
| 1          | 65000    | 1.158 |
| ...        | ...      | ...   |

### Output

Output of Selfish is a matrix of p-values indicating the probability of differential conformation (Smaller values mean more significant.).
X and Y coordinates indicate the bin midpoints.  
Another optional output is the log fold changes file. It is simply produced by `log2((map1 + 1) / (map2 + 1))`  
File format of the outputs is a binary numpy file. It can be read by using Numpy as follows.

```python
import numpy as np
matrix = np.load("/path/to/output/selfish.npy")
```
